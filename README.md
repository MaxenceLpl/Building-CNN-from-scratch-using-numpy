# Convolutional Networks from Scratch (NumPy)

This project implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) **from scratch** using only NumPy, without any deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The goal is to understand and build the fundamental components of CNNs, including:

### Features Implemented:
✅ **Layers**: Convolutional, Dense (Fully Connected), Pooling, Flatten  
✅ **Activation Functions**: ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax  
✅ **Loss Functions**: Cross-Entropy, Mean Squared Error (MSE) with gradient computation  
✅ **Backpropagation**: Full implementation of gradient computation for all layers  
✅ **Optimization**: Adam optimizer with batch processing  
✅ **Training Pipeline**: Forward pass, loss computation, backward pass, and weight updates  

### Installation & Usage
Simply clone the repo and run the provided scripts to train a CNN on a dataset like MNIST.
